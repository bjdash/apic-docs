# Installing APIC

APIC is available as a Chrome packaged App \(Also works with Chrome OS\), web app \(to be used in a browser\), Native app for Windows, Mac \(coming soon\) and Linux \(Coming Soon\). You can select any option that suites your need.

## APIC Chrome App

You can install APIC from Google Chrome's app store and launch it from Apps panel. To install APIC Chrome app, head over to [Chromes's app store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/apic-complete-api-solutio/ggnhohnkfcpcanfekomdkjffnfcjnjam), click on the **Add to chrome** button and you are all set to go.

## Installing the Native app

APIC also comes as native apps for windows \(.exe\), mac \(.dmg\) and a linux version coming very soon. You can download the native version [here](https://apic.app/#Download).

## Using the Web App

You can use APIC directly from your browser by visiting [https://apic.app/app](https://apic.app/app).

**Warning**: The web version of APIC \(API testing module\) suffers with the limitation of CORS where browsers don't allow access to resources of other domains unless the response contains **Access-Control-Allow-Origin** header with a value of "**\***" or "[https://apic.app](https://apic.app)" \(without the quotes\). To overcome this issue you need to install a plugin that will allow APIC to access resources on other domains by adding **Access-Control-Allow-Origin: \*** header. You can download the helper plugin for chrome from [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/apic-extension/dejjobgejdajdjjhjcindbjcfohoiehn](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/apic-extension/dejjobgejdajdjjhjcindbjcfohoiehn?hl=en)

For Firefox/IE/Safari you can install equivalent plugins that allows modifying **Access-Control-Allow-Origin** header.
