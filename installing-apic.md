# Installing APIC

APIC is available as a Chrome packaged App \(Also works with Chrome OS\), web app \(coming soon\), Native app for Windows, Mac and Linux \(Coming Soon\). You can select any option that suits your need.

### APIC Chrome App

You can install APIC from Google Chrome's app store and launch it from Apps panel. To install APIC Chrome app, head over to [Chromes's app store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/apic/ndlppagggobloiddihlgkhambleecphp), click on the **Add to chrome** button and you are all set to go.

### Installing the Native app

* **Windows - **Want to install APIC as standalone app? Download the exe from [http://myapic.com/release/win64/apic Setup 0.0.1.exe](http://myapic.com/release/win64/apic Setup 0.0.1.exe)
* **macOS - Coming soon**
* **Linux - Coming soon**

### Using the Web App

You can use APIC directly from your browser by visiting [http://myapic.com/app](http://myapic.com/app).

Warning: The web version of APIC \(APIC testing\) suffers with the limitation of CORS where browsers don't allow access to resources of other domains unless the response contains **Access-Control-Allow-Origin **header with a value of "**\***" or "**myapic.com**" \(without the quotes\). To overcome this issue you need to install a plugin that will allow APIC to access resources on other domains by adding **Access-Control-Allow-Origin: \* **header. You can download the helper plugin for chrome from [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/apic-extension/dejjobgejdajdjjhjcindbjcfohoiehn](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/apic-extension/dejjobgejdajdjjhjcindbjcfohoiehn?hl=en)

For Firefox/IE/Safari you can install equivalent plugins that allow modifying **Access-Control-Allow-Origin **header.
