### Project Setting {#proj-setting}

You can set some basic information about your project like **API host name**, **API base path** and **Allowed protocols**, under the Settings panel in your projects home screen. 

### **Create Folders** {#create-folder}

Folders can be used to group and organize related components in one place.

### Create Models {#create-models}

Have a schema that you want to reuse in multiple places? Create a Model. Models represent schema objects that allow the definition of input and output data types. Should be used to reduce duplication. Models can be reused with another models, in traits or with endpoints. Use $ref to refer an existing model.
