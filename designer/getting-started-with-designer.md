# Getting Started With APIC designer

Its highly prefered to design your APIs before starting to develope them. With APIC's API designer you can do a lot than just designing API endpoints. To start either you can [import an already exported APIC API project](#import-proj) or [start from scratch](#designscratch).

### Creating an API design from scratch {#designscratch}

To create a new API project click on the **+ icon** and fill up the required fields like **name,** **version** etc and you are all set for designing your awesome API with APIC.

### Importing existing API projects {#import-proj}

If you already have an exported API project then importing that into your workspace is just a click away. Just click on the Import icon present beside your workspace and browse the exported file. APIC will import the project into your workspace.

### What's next?

Well, you can start [some actual design](/designer/working-with-api-design.md).
