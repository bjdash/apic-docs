## Creating a Team

To create a new team click on the `New Team` button present on the top of the team summary page, give an awesome name for your team and click `Create`. Now you can add members to the team and share stuff with them.

## Adding/Removing Team members

You can add or remove a member from your team from the details view of the team. To do so click on the **pencil icon** or **add member icon** beside your team which will open the detail view of the team. You can also change the name of your team here.

To add a member enter the email id of the user in the add member section, select permission type and click add. If the user is already registered with APIC then he/she will be directly added as a member in your team. Other wise APIC can invite your friends/coleagues by sending them an email.

You can remove a team member by clicking on the thrash icon beside the member in the Team members list as shown below

## Deleting a team

You can delete a team by clicking on the thrash icon beside the team in the list of teams shown above. Once you delete a team all the stuff \(APIProjects, Requests, Test Suites etc\) you have shared with the members will be removed from their APIC's environment.

## Existing a team

If you don't want to be a member of a team any more then you can leave the team by clicking on the Exit Team button shown in the **Members of Team** list. Once you leave a team you will loose everything that has been shared with you as a member of that team.

## What's next?

Do you know you can generate beautiful functional documentation for your API project with APIC and also share it with third-party developers. APIC's `Published Docs` allow you to publish the documentation online for other third-party developers whome you want to get on board for using your PAIs.
