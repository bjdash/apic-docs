# CI/CD Integration

We understand how difficult it gets to automate API testing. With a little help from APIC you can reuse your Test Suites to automate your API testing. Integrate [APIC \(apic-cli\)](https://github.com/apic-apps/apic-cli) with your CI/CD pipeline in few steps and every time you push new code or deploy a new build in one of your environments, APIC will run your Test Suites automatically.
