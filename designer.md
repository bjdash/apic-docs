# APIC API Designer

Every API development starts with a design and if you are one of those who believes in design-first approach then APIC got you covered. Designing your APIs before starting development could significantly reduce cost, effort and time to market. No matter how complex your API design may be, with APIC's designer tool you can convert them to beautiful visual representations.

Here's what you can do with the PAIC designer

* [Have an existing Swagger specification or APIC exported project? Import it to APIC](/designer/getting-started-with-designer.md)
* [Dont have a specification? Create your design from scratch](/designer/getting-started-with-designer.md)
* [Getting started with your API design](/designer/getting-started-with-designer.md)
* [Adding Folders/Groups to your design](/designer/create-folder.md)
* [Creating Models](/designer/create-model.md)
* [Creating Traits](/designer/create-trait.md)
* [Creating Endpoints](/designer/create-endpoint.md)
* [Export your API design](/designer/export-docs.md)
