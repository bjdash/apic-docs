# Sharing

APIC's sharing feature allows yuo to share your API Project design, Requests & folders, Test Case projects & Test Suits and environments with others users. You can share your stuff with a team and once sharing is complete it will be available to all the members of the shared team. If you desire to remove sharing you can do that as well by un-sharing the object.

The **`Share`** option is available with each API Design Project, Saved request folders, Test Case projects. On clicking Share a popup will appear to select the team you want to share with. If you don't have a team then go to [Dashboard ](/dashboard.md)and [create one](/dashboard/team-management.md). Select the Team you want to share with and you are done.
